# The Road to Safe Cycling in NYC

## DESCRIPTION
Thanks to major initiatives like Vision Zero and Citi Bike, the number of bike lines in New York City has more than doubled in the past decade. But even today, nine in ten cyclists killed are killed while riding outside of bike lanes. There's still plenty of work to do.

The interactive above maps the location of all NYC motor vehicle collisions since July 2012 that resulted in at least one cyclist injury (red dots) or cyclist fatality (white dots). Each point, when clicked, contains additional information about the specific date, time, and reason for collision.

The purpose of this project is not to encourage all current and potential cyclists to opt for the subway, but to remind the entire cycling community that we must continue to advocate for safer roads at the grassroots level, while remembering the individuals to whom we owe our increasingly safer city.

## PROJECT PROCEDURE
_describe your data processing, visualization selection, and analyses post-visualization_

First of all, the sample of links provided for this assignment have me wonder what can even be considered an “interactive.” Before now, I would only have considered two of these examples to be interactives… I would like to know what qualifies the rest of these as well. Regardless, the [Pitch Interactive](http://drones.pitchinteractive.com/) graphic is superior for the types of data it communicates, its impactful storytelling, and its clear and intentional design/usability.
